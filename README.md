# A-Decade-of-1000-Goals
A data analysis project exploring goal trends in Europe's top 5 football leagues (2013–2024), examining the impact of on and off-pitch factors and answering what is shaping the goal trends and how much?

# A Decade of 1000 Goals: Data Analysis of Top 5 European Leagues (2013–2024) 

## Overview 

This project analyzes goal-scoring trends across the top five European football leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1) over the past decade using a combination of R, Tableau, and Excel, and the project examines how key factors such as transfer spending, foreign ownership, revenue growth, rule changes (VAR & 5-sub rule), and key player influence shaped the evolution of total goals. 

## Key Questions  
- What are the main trends in total goals and goals per game?
- How did economic factors like spending and revenue correlate with goal outputs?
- Did rule changes like VAR or the 5-substitution rule alter game dynamics?
- What role did key player contributions and tactical evolution play?

## Tools Used 

- *R* – Data cleaning, transformation, and calculation
- *Tableau* – Interactive and static data visualizations
- *Excel* – Minor aggregations and data input
- *Canva* – Presentation design

## Structure

- data/ – Contains raw and cleaned datasets.
- scripts/ – R scripts used for analysis and visuals.
- visuals/ – Tableau dashboards and exports.
- presentation/ – Final PDF report titled "A Decade of 1000 Goals". 
  
## Conclusion 

Despite massive financial growth, including a 265% increase in Premier League spending and significant revenue gains across all leagues, the total goals per game increased by only 4.45%. This highlights that on-field factors—particularly tactical shifts and goal distribution are more predictive of goal-scoring outcomes than financial inputs alone.

## Future Research 

- Deeper exploration of tactical formations
- Advanced player-level analytics (e.g., xG, pressing metrics)
- Broader comparative study with non-European leagues
