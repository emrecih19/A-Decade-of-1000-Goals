## Dataset Source

- **Name:** Football Data from Transfermarkt

This dataset contains match-level and player-level data for the top 5 European football leagues between 2000 and 2024, including:

## Used Files & Format

I used the following file from the dataset:

- `tm_football_data-games.csv`

### Relevant Columns:
- `date`  
- `home_club_goals`  
- `away_club_goals`  
- `competition_id`

These columns were used to compute:
- Total goals per season  
- Goals-per-game trends by league and year

## Preprocessing Notes

- Filtered games between 2013/2014 and 2023/2024  
- Calculated total goals as: `home_club_goals + away_club_goals`  
- Mapped match dates to corresponding seasons  
- Cleaned missing values and adjusted the 2019/2020 Ligue 1 season (shortened due to COVID-19)
